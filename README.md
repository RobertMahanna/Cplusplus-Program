# Cplusplus-Program
# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
Project 6-3 was a program created using C++ and Python. It was created with the intention of completing some basic mathematical tasks; specifically, making a multiplication table for any number for the numbers 1 through 10, and doubling a given number.
# What did you do particularly well?
I believe I integrated Python into C++ in a manor that is both intuitive and readable. 
# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I think there are a couple areas where I could imporve this code. The first would be to define a C++ function for my program. This would allow me to call just one line of code in my main function and that would help with the readability of my code. Another area would be in how I display the multiplication table. How I have it set up now is more like a list, instead of a table. The final area I believe I could make a change would be in my input verification. As it stands, if a string in passed through as an input, the program will run the error code for each character in the string before allowing a new input. 
# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging piece of code that I wrote was the input verification. I put forth my issues in creating the verification to stack overflow and multiple coding help subreddits. By posing my question to these communities, I was able to learn more about how input verification works in C++. Unfortunately I was not able to further refine my code before the due date of the project.
# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The skill that was most useful in the following project for the Grocery-Table was the usage of the switch-case function in C++. I was able to directly bring over this chunk of code and edit it for the following project. 
# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable by calling multiple functions throughout the code. This helps when in maintaining the code by having fewer lines in the executable code, it helps with the readablility by dividing up large chunks of code into smaller segments that are easier to peruse, and it helps with the adaptability by allowing future coders to only have to edit the funtions once to create large changes.
